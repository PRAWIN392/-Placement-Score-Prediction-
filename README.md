# -Placement-Score-Prediction-
~ In this project, we are going to discuss how to predict the placement score of a student based on their using Linear regression algorithm.
~ This study focuses on a system, that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on their CGPA.
~ This predictor uses a machine-learning algorithm to give the result. The algorithm used is Linear regression.

Linear Regression:

~ Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.
~ This line can be used to predict future values.
