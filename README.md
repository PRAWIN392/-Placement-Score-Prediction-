# -Placement-Score-Prediction-

~ This Project is about to Predict the Placement Score of a student based on their CGPA using Machine Learning Algorithm.

~ Since this is a Regression based problem (were we use to predict the continuous values) we use a supervised machine learning algorithm called Linear Regression.

~ This study focuses on a system, that predicts if a student would be placed or not based on their CGPA using Machine Learning Algorithm.

Linear Regression:

~ Linear regression uses the relationship between the data-points to draw a straight line through all them.

~ This regression line can be used to predict future values.
